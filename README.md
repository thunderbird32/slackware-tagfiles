# slackware-tagfiles
This repo will contain my customized Slackware Tagfiles for installing a base install of Slackware to my personal preferences (i.e. console only, DHCP, slackpkg, etc). May later also contain slackpkg templates for more complete configurations (X with various WMs or DEs, server configurations, etc).
